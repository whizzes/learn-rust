## Basics

1. Calculate the salary of a person, knowing the number of hours worked in the month and the value of the hour.

2. Calculate the amount that a person must pay when buying a refrigerator of X pesos and for paying in cash they give him a 10% discount. How much does he pay?

3. Convert lengths from miles to km and from inches to cm, if: 1 mile = 1.60935 km.
1 inch = 2.534 cm

4. Find the length of the hypotenuse of a triangle given the measure of its legs

5. Enter a three-digit number and display the second digit.

6. Enter a number. If it is positive, calculate its square root, if it is negative, show its square, and if it is zero, show “Error. You have entered a null value.”

7. Enter the ages of two people. If one of them is of legal age and the other is a minor, calculate and display their average. Otherwise show the two ages.

8. Enter two numbers, calculate and display the quotient of the first by the second, as long as the divisor is not zero. In the latter case, display the legend “the quotient cannot be done”.

9. Enter the value of a company's annual profit and calculate its withholding according to whether it is within the following parameters

Gain | Retention
--- | ---
`<= 10000` | Zero
`> 10000` and `<= 15000` | 2% over (gain -10000)
`> 150000` | 300+5% over (gain -15000)

10. Calculate the amount that a car must pay in a parking lot taking into account the hours and minutes of use as data. The value of the hour is $45 and if the minutes exceed 15, the amount is increased by one hour. The minimum charge is one hour.

11. Enter the code for the type of call: 1. Local 2. Interurban 3. International and the duration in minutes of the call. If the minute costs $0.25 for the local call,
$0.40 for the long-distance call and $1.05 for the international call, design an algorithm that allows calculating the amount to be paid for said call.

12. Calculate the kilometers traveled by a car knowing the initial and current mileage. Show a legend according to the distance traveled:

Value | Legend
--- | ---
For 100 km or less | “Patience, there is a long way to go”
More than 100 km and less than 200 | “Stop for breakfast”
More than 200 km | “It is recommended to load fuel”

13. The user must think of one of the following characters: Lio Messi, Mauricio Macri and Mirtha Legrand. The program through some appropriate questions (age, sex, occupation, etc.) should show what character it is. Example: if you are a man and an athlete, you will have to say Lio Messi

14. Enter a two-digit number, if it is greater than 50, show it inverted. Otherwise show the figure that corresponds to the units.

15. Enter the measure of an angle and determine if it is acute, obtuse, right, zero or flat. If the entered value is greater than 180o, display the legend "invalid angle" and enter a new value.

16. Enter two numbers and without solving the multiplication display a legend depending on whether the product is negative, positive or zero.

17. Enter the measures of two angles expressed in degrees minutes and seconds and find the sum. (remember that minutes and seconds must not exceed 60)

## Loops

1. Enter numbers up to a multiple of 3. Show the last number entered.

2. Calculate the weekly average of expenses in a month, entering as data:
  - Week number
  - Weekly expense

> The process ends when "week number" is equal to 5.

3. Enter numbers until the last is zero. Calculate the number of positives.

4. At the end of a day in a secondary school, a statistics of absences is made, knowing each course:

  - Course (1-5)
  - Presents
  - Absent

You are asked to calculate:

  - For each course the percentage of those present over the total
  - Number of absentees at school
  - Course with the highest number of absentees

5. Read the month number and show how many days are there in that month (current year)
6. Enter 10 numbers greater than 3 and less than 8. Show the value entered in numbers and letters.

7. Read two numbers, display the following menu, being able to select any option and repeat this operation until 5 is selected.

8. 100 positive integers are entered, for each entered number the operator is asked to select the operation to perform: if the operator enters 1, the program must return the factorial of the entered number; If the operator enters 2, the program must ask the operator for the power to which he wants to raise the entered number and must display the result, and for any other operation value, the program must report whether the number entered is even, odd, or null.

9. A company settles salaries according to the category of each employee and pays per hour according to the following table:

  - Category 1: $150
  - Category 2: $200
  - Category 3: $250
  - Category 4: $280

Design a program that allows entering the category of each employee and the hours they work in the month and calculate:

  - Calculate the gross salary and the net salary (discount 17% of contributions) of each employee
  - Calculate the total salaries paid by the company
  - Determine how many employees of each category there are.
10. A census is carried out in the province of Buenos Aires. For each registered person, sex (1.F, 2.M), age and studies completed (1 for primary studies, 2 for secondary studies or 3 for tertiary studies) are entered.

Design a program that allows entering the data and calculating:

  - Number of men older than 45 years.
  - Number of women surveyed.
  - Average age of people for each type of study.
  - Percentage of women with tertiary studies.
  - Percentage of men over 30 years of age with tertiary studies.
  - Average age of women over 40 with secondary education.

> The data load ends when you enter 0 in age and studies completed.

11. A textile company wants to process its sales. Every time a person makes a purchase, they are given an invoice containing:

  - Invoice No.
  - Item code
  - Item Quantity
  - Unit price

Only one article code is recorded on each invoice and the article codes can be 1, 3, 5 and 7.

Design a program that allows data entry and calculate:

  - Total of each invoice
  - Grand total billed
  - Quantity sold (in units) for each of the items.
  - Total items sold
  - Number of invoices issued for each of the items.
  - Invoice number with the highest value (in $)
  - No. of article with less quantity ordered (by invoice, "not" the total)
  - Percentage of sales (in pesos) of each one of the articles over the total.

> The data entry ends with an invoice number equal to zero.
